# MQTT integration

[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol designed for small sensors and mobile devices optimized for low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks.

Windmill allows you to create MQTT triggers, enabling subscriptions to a specific MQTT broker. When a message is received on the subscribed topic, the designated script or workflow set at trigger creation will be executed automatically.
